     Product Movements – Track product transfers between locations.

     Report Page – Summarizes all movements and current stock levels.

     Sidebar Navigation – Toggle sidebar for smooth navigation between pages.

    Database: SQLite (inventory.db)

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)
